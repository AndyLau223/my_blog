#### Standard Deviation

Standard deviation(SD) is a staatistical measure that tells you how spread out the numbers in a data set. While the 'mean' gives your the average, the standard deviation tells you how much the individual numbers of the group differ from the average.

Think of standard deviation as a "consistency" or "reliability" score.
- Low standard deviation: This means the data points are very close to the mean. It suggests the data is consistent and preditable
- High standard deviation: This means the data points are spread out over a wide range. It suggests high varability or "noise" in the data.




Population standard deviation $\sigma$ : $\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2}$

Display:
$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2}
\quad\text{where}\quad
\mu = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i
$$

Sample (unbiased) standard deviation (s): $s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}$

Display:
$$
s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
\quad\text{where}\quad
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
$$
